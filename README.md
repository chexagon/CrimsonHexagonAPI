##Building and Running the Site Locally

A static preview of this demo can be viewed directly, [here](http://extras.forsight.ch/crimsonhexagon_api_demo/). 

The ForSight API visualization demo was built with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), the [express.js](http://expressjs.com/) web application framework, and employs the [c3.js](http://c3js.org/) library to format and generate all data visualizations. Naturally, users wishing to install and run this app locally will need to have Node installed on their machine before continuing. For users currently without Node, please refer to the [Node docs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on instructions on how to install. 

Once this has been completed, please follow the steps below to begin the build process:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/chexagon/crimsonhexagon_api_demo.git
$ cd crimsonhexagon_api_demo/

$ npm install
```

Note that in order to have the demo run locally, you will have to pass in values throughout the code where auth-token (`auth`) and monitor IDâ€™s (`monitorId`) are queried. These variables are both located in the `app.js` file and the areas have been visibly commented in the source code for your convenience.

Along with this, it is important to note that certain dependency files from the `c3`, `d3`, and `bootstrap` node modules have been copied to the `public` folder in our directory. This is so that our express middleware can serve the static files appropriately to our app.

Once all dependencies have been installed, from the root of the `crimsonhexagon_api_demo/` directory, it is now possible to run:

```
$ node app.js
```

After initializing the connection to port 3000, you can point your browser at `http://localhost:3000` and examine the site live; note that ending the terminal process will terminate the site. 


#Source Code

The app is constructed through a series of callback functions which query various ForSight API endpoints and feed the returned data to our c3.js visualization charts. Specifics on JSON structure and data returned from the endpoints can be researched within our [API docs](https://api.crimsonhexagon.com/api/chs/index.html). As mentioned above, both express.js and the socket.io library are used to serve the generated data to our client side web page. 

In our source code, the basis of all functions which generate and send our data are constructed similar to the following: 

```javascript
var twitterResults = function(callback) {

  var monitorId = "2086809677";

  var twitterUrl = ('https://forsight.crimsonhexagon.com/api/monitor/twittersocial/totalengagement?id=' + monitorId + '&start=' + startDate + '&end=' + endDate + '&auth=' + auth);

  var tweetMentions = [];
  var tweetReplies = [];
  var tweetRetweets = [];
  var tweetCollection = {};

  request({
    url: twitterUrl,
    method: 'GET'
  }, function(err, response, body) {
    if (!err && response.statusCode === 200) {
      var data = JSON.parse(body);
      for (var i = 0; i < data.dailyResults.length; i++) {
        tweetMentions.push(data.dailyResults[i].mentions);
        tweetReplies.push(data.dailyResults[i].replies);
        tweetRetweets.push(data.dailyResults[i].retweets);
      } 
      tweetCollection = [tweetMentions, tweetReplies, tweetRetweets];
    }
    callback(tweetCollection);
  });
}

//sends collected data to client
function sendTwitterData(tweetCollection) {
  io.on('connection', function(socket) {
    socket.emit('twitterData', tweetCollection);
  });
}

twitterResults(sendTwitterData);
```

To briefly explain the process here: we have our function expression, `twitterResults()`, which using the request module places a call to our API for total engagement metrics on the Twitter content source. This function then generates a series of arrays storing the data needed to run our visualizations on the client side. 

Once this request is completed and our arrays have been formed, we invoke our callback function, `sendTwitterData()` which sends the object to our web page via socket once a user connection has been established.  

Most functions throughout our app.js file are built in this fashion. 

##A Quick Note On Dates & Browserify

All visualizations pull up to date data stemming from the last seven calendar days. On the client side, dates for our charts are generated with the [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) library and its plugin [twix.js](http://isaaccambron.com/twix.js/). [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) has been used to require these packages within our web page. To change the date ranges for which data has been queried within our API calls, it is necessary to edit the `startDate` and `endDate` variables within our `app.js` file.    

It will be necessary to run the following within the `public` directory:

```
$ browserify index.js > bundle.js
```
This will build our bundle from the `index.js` file and ensure that our required node packages are functional on the client side.
