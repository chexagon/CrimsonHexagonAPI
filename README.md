##Building and Running the Site Locally

The ForSight API visualization demo was built with node.js, the express.js web application framework, and employs the c3.js library to format and generate all data visualizations. Naturally, users wishing to install and run locally will need to have Node installed on their machine before continuing. For users currently without Node, please refer to the Node docs on instructions on how to install. 

Once this has been completed, please follow the steps below to begin the build process:

```
git clone https://github.com/chexagon/crimsonhexagon_api_demo.git
cd forsight_

npm install
npm run build
```

Note that in order to have the demo run locally, you will have to pass in values throughout the code where auth-token and monitor IDâ€™s are queried. These areas have been visibly commented in the source code for your convenience.

Once this has been completed, from the root of the forsight_ directory, it is now possible to run:

```
node app.js
```

After initializing the connection to port 3000, you can point your browser at `http://localhost:3000` and examine the site live; note that ending the terminal process will terminate the site. 


#Reporting Bugs/ Submitting User Feedback

Please report all bugs/ issues with this app via our Help Center as you would with any other issue. Please be sure to indicate your reference to this demo within the ticket request.

#Source Code

The app is constructed through a series of callback functions which query various ForSight API endpoints and feed the returned data to our c3.js visualization charts. Specifics on JSON structure and data returned from the endpoints can be researched within our API docs. As mentioned above, both express.js and the socket.io library are used to serve the generated data to our client side web page. 

In our source code, the basis of all function which generate our data look similar to the following: 

```
var twitterResults = function(callback) {

  var monitorId = "2086809677";

  var twitterUrl = ('https://forsight.crimsonhexagon.com/api/monitor/twittersocial/totalengagement?id=' + monitorId + '&start=' + startDate + '&end=' + endDate + '&auth=' + auth);

  var tweetMentions = [];
  var tweetReplies = [];
  var tweetRetweets = [];
  var tweetCollection = {};

  request({
    url: twitterUrl,
    method: 'GET'
  }, function(err, response, body) {
    if (!err && response.statusCode === 200) {
      var data = JSON.parse(body);
      for (var i = 0; i < data.dailyResults.length; i++) {
        tweetMentions.push(data.dailyResults[i].mentions);
        tweetReplies.push(data.dailyResults[i].replies);
        tweetRetweets.push(data.dailyResults[i].retweets);
      } 
      tweetCollection = [tweetMentions, tweetReplies, tweetRetweets];
    }
    callback(tweetCollection);
  });
}

//sends collected data to client
function sendTwitterData(tweetCollection) {
  io.on('connection', function(socket) {
    socket.emit('twitterData', tweetCollection);
  });
}

twitterResults(sendTwitterData);
```

To briefly explain the process here: we have our function expression, twitterResults() which using the request module places a call to our API for total engagement metrics on the Twitter content source. This function then generates a series of arrays storing the data needed to run our visualizations on the client side. 

Once this request is completed and our arrays have been formed, we invoke our callback function, sendTwitterData() which sends the object to our web page via socket once a user connection has been established.  

Most functions throughout our app.js file are built in this fashion.
